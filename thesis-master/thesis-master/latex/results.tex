\section{Scaling Study: Model Saturation}
The primary objective of this thesis was to determine the scalability of BMI prediction models. We trained the pipeline on increasing subset sizes. The results are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:saturation}.

    \caption{\textbf{Model Performance vs. Sample Size.} The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) decreases as the number of samples increases from 1k to 10k. A significant improvement is observed between 1k and 5k, with the curve beginning to flatten (saturate) between 5k and 10k, indicating diminishing returns for additional data.}

\section{Performance Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1k Samples:} High variance and higher RMSE. The model struggles to generalize.
    \item \textbf{5k Samples:} Significant drop in RMSE. The variance between seeds (red error bars) also decreases, indicating a more stable model.
    \item \textbf{10k Samples:} The best performance, but the marginal gain over 5k is smaller than the gain from 1k to 5k.
\end{itemize}

This confirms our hypothesis that while "more data is better," a dataset of 5,000-10,000 samples is sufficient to capture the primary signal for BMI prediction in this cohort.

\section{Feature Importance Analysis}
To understand the biological drivers of the prediction, we extracted the top 20 most predictive features from the 10,000-sample model (Figure \ref{fig:featimp}). The importance scores represent the absolute magnitude of the GLM coefficients, identifying the microbial taxa that contribute most strongly to the BMI prediction.
