\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis presented a robust, scalable, and reproducible framework for microbiome-based phenotype prediction. We successfully:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implemented a \texttt{mikropml} pipeline reproducible via Snakemake.
    \item Demonstrated that feature prefiltering enables large-scale analysis on local hardware.
    \item Showed that BMI prediction accuracy saturates between 5,000 and 10,000 samples, providing a benchmark for future study designs.
\end{enumerate}

These findings empower researchers to conduct high-quality microbiome ML studies without being limited by access to supercomputing resources.
